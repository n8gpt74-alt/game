Put production unicorn model files here:
- unicorn.glb (preferred)
- unicorn_placeholder.glb (optional fallback)

Expected clips inside GLB:
- Idle
- Eat
- Wash or HappySplash
- Play (jump/spin)
- Heal
- Chat
- Evolve (optional)

If clips or model are missing, app uses runtime primitive unicorn animation fallback.
